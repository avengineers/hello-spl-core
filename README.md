# Getting started with Software Product Line (SPL)

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your SPL using the `spl-core` repository. Follow these steps  to get started.


## Step 1: Clone the `spl-core` Repository 

First, clone the `spl-core` repository to your local machine using the following Git command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/avengineers/spl-core 
```

This will create a local copy of the repository on your system.


## Step 2: Follow the README.md

Once you've cloned the `spl-core` repository, proceed by following the instructions in the README.md file to create your SPL project.


## Step 3 (Optional): Version Control

It's highly recommended to manage your SPL project in a version control system, such as Bitbucket, GitHub, GitLab, or similar platforms.


## Step 4: Install Necessary Tools

You need to install essential tools for your project. You can do this in either of the following ways:

Run the `install-mandatory.bat` file or use PowerShell and run `.\build.ps1 -install`.

After performing this step, please note that the Pipfile.lock will be updated with all the project dependencies.
